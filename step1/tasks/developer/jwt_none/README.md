## idea
- in froned there will be register login profile page about page
- in backend there will be 3 routes
- to keep track of users we use a json file which acts as a database
- on login a token is issued 
- profile is a protected page so without token in fronend there will a sample profile
- with token a requet is sent to backend ,and the users profile is given to fronted
- user is tasked with loggin as another user say admin
